# Expense Tracker Backend

A backend service built with Rust for tracking and managing personal expenses.

## Description

This is a RESTful API service that allows users to track and manage their monthly expenses. The service stores expense data in a JSON file and provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting expense records.

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
DATA_FILE_PATH=/path/to/your/expense_data.json
SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
SERVER_PORT=8080
RUST_LOG=debug
````

### Environment Variables

- `DATA_FILE_PATH`: Full path to the JSON file where expense data will be stored
- `SERVER_HOST`: Host address for the server
- `SERVER_PORT`: Port number for the server
- `RUST_LOG`: Log level (debug, info, warn, error)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd expense-tracker-be
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the server:

```bash
cargo run
```

The server will start on the configured host and port (default: http://127.0.0.1:8080)

## API Endpoints

(Add your API endpoints and their descriptions here. For example:)

- `GET /expenses` - Retrieve all expenses
- `POST /expenses` - Create a new expense
- `PUT /expenses/{id}` - Update an existing expense
- `DELETE /expenses/{id}` - Delete an expense

## Development

To run the project in development mode with auto-reload:

```bash
cargo watch -x run
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)

1. Adding specific API endpoint documentation with request/response examples
2. Including any specific setup requirements for your project
3. Adding troubleshooting guides
4. Including information about the project's architecture
5. Adding badges for build status, test coverage, etc.
6. Including contact information or contribution guidelines
